## crowd source geo data tool

This a very simple application to add and visualize information on a map. The user can add a point or draw a polygon and inform something about the location which was highlighted on the map. The information will be associated with the coordinates that were informed.

The application was built entirely with node.js. On the back-end, I used express, with ejs as templates and mongoose to better manage my mongodb database. On the front-end, I used bootstrap to help with a simple style and leaflet.js to build the map.
